> ___Fully customisable syntax-highlighted textareas.___

![Using code-input with many different themes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69071853/133924472-05edde5c-23e7-4350-a41b-5a74d2dc1a9a.gif)
*This demonstration uses themes from [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), two syntax-highlighting programs which work well and have compatibility built-in with code-input.*

## What does it do?
**`code-input`** lets you **turn any ordinary JavaScript syntax-highlighting theme and program into customisable syntax-highlighted textareas** using an HTML custom element. It uses vanilla CSS to superimpose a `textarea` on a `pre code` block, then handles indentations, scrolling and fixes any resulting bugs with JavaScript. To see how it works in more detail, please see [this CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-editable-textarea-that-supports-syntax-highlighted-code/ "Creating an Editable Textarea That Supports Syntax-Highlighted Code") I wrote.

## What are the advantages of using code-input, and what can it be used for?
Unlike other front-end code-editor projects, the simplicity of how `code-input` works means it is **highly customisable**. As it is not a full-featured editor, you can **choose what features you want it to include, and use your favourite syntax-highlighting algorithms and themes**.

The `<code-input>` element works like a `<textarea>` and therefore **works in HTML5 forms and supports using the `value` and `placeholder` attributes, as well as the `onchange` event.**

## Getting Started With `code-input`
`code-input` is designed to be **both easy to use and customisable**. Here's how to use it to create syntax-highlighted textareas: 
- **First, import your favourite syntax-highlighter's JS and CSS theme files** to turn editable. 
- Then, import the CSS and JS files of `code-input` from a downloaded release or a CDN. The non-minified files are useful for using during development.
  ```html
  <!--In the <head>-->
  <script src="path/to/code-input.min.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/code-input.min.css">
  ```

- The next step is to set up a `template` to link `code-input` to your syntax-highlighter. If you're using Prism.js or highlight.js, you can use the built-in template, or you can create your own otherwise. In these examples, I am registering the template as `"syntax-highlighted"`, but you can use any template name as long as you are consistent.

  - *Highlight.js:*
    ```js
    codeInput.registerTemplate("syntax-highlighted", codeInput.templates.hljs(hljs));
    ```

  - *Prism.js:*
    ```js
    codeInput.registerTemplate("syntax-highlighted", codeInput.templates.prism(Prism));
    ```

  - *Custom:*
    ```js
    codeInput.registerTemplate("syntax-highlighted", codeInput.templates.custom(
      function(result_element) { /* Highlight function - with `pre code` code element */
        /* Highlight code in result_element - code is already escaped so it doesn't become HTML */
      },
      true, /* Optional - Is the `pre` element styled as well as the `code` element? Changing this to false uses the code element as the scrollable one rather than the pre element */
      true, /* Optional - This is used for editing code - setting this to true overrides the Tab key and uses it for indentation */
      false /* Optional - Setting this to true passes the `<code-input>` element as a second argument to the highlight function to be used for getting data- attribute values and using the DOM for the code-input */
    ));
    ```

- Now that you have registered a template, you can use the custom `<code-input>` element in HTML. If you have more than one template registered, you need to add the template name as the `template` attribute. With the element, using the `lang` attribute will add a `language-{value}` class to the `pre code` block. You can now use HTML attributes and events to make your element as simple or interactive as you like! 
  ```HTML
  <code-input lang="HTML"></code-input>
  ```
  *or*
  ```HTML
  <code-input lang="HTML" placeholder="Type code here" value="<a href='https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input'>code-input</a>" template="syntax-highlighted" onchange="console.log('Your code is', this.value)"></code-input>
  ```
